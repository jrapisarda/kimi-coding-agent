1. Verdict: Tests were skipped due to a missing executable, so no smoke tests ran and no coverage was reported.

2. Critical observations:
- The test command was not executed (Status: skipped, Return Code: not executed) with Skip Reason: missing-executable.
- STDERR shows a Windows "File not found" error: "[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified" â€” likely indicating npm/node (or the test runner) is not available in PATH.
- As a result, both smoke checks ("renders dashboard page placeholder" and "README scaffold present") were not validated and coverage is unavailable.

3. Recommended next action: Ensure Node.js/npm are installed and on the system PATH (or that the test runner executable referenced by package.json exists), then reinstall dependencies (npm ci) and re-run the tests (npm run test -- --watch=false).
