  "document_excerpt": "# Advanced Dashboard Specification (Sprint Testing)\n\nThis specification describes a more comprehensive dashboard application for testing development agents with realistic complexity.\n\n## Overview\n\nBuild a Next.js 15 dashboard application with TypeScript, App Router, and modern UI patterns. The application should serve as an analytics platform with multiple data views and interactive components.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### 1. Authentication & Authorization\n- Implement mock authentication with role-based access (Admin, User, Viewer)\n- Session management with token refresh simulation\n- Protected routes and route guards\n\n### 2. Dashboard Layout\n- Responsive sidebar navigation with collapsible menu\n- Top header with user profile, notifications, and search\n- Breadcrumb navigation\n- Multiple dashboard views: Overview, Analytics, Users, Settings\n\n### 3. Data Visualization\n- Interactive charts (line, bar, pie) using a charting library\n- Real-time data updates (simulated)\n- Customizable date range filters\n- Export functionality for charts and tables\n\n### 4. Data Management\n- Sortable, filterable, paginated data tables\n- Bulk operations (select, delete, export)\n- Inline editing for user record...",
  "model_analysis": "Summary of expectations\n- Deliver a Next.js 15 application written in TypeScript using the App Router that functions as an analytics dashboard.\n- Follow modern UI patterns (responsive layout, component-driven design, accessible controls).\n- Include multiple data views (Overview, Analytics, Users, Settings) with a responsive sidebar, top header (profile, notifications, search), and breadcrumbs.\n- Implement mock authentication with role-based access (Admin, User, Viewer), protected routes/route guards, and simulated session token refresh.\n- Provide interactive data visualization (line, bar, pie) using a charting library with simulated real\u2011time updates and date-range filters.\n- Implement data management features: sortable/filterable/paginated tables, bulk operations (select/delete/export), and inline editing for user records.\n- Export functionality for charts and tables (files) and simulated real-time updates for charts/tables.\n\nAcceptance criteria (testable, pass/fail)\n1. Project, build, and runtime\n   - The repository boots with npm/yarn/pnpm and builds successfully with Next.js 15 and TypeScript without type errors.\n   - App Router is used (app/ directory + server/client components as appropriate).\n\n2. Authentication & Authorization\n   - A login UI exists and accepts mock credentials; login yields a client-side session token.\n   - Role assignment is possible (Admin, User, Viewer); the UI shows/hides controls based on role.\n   - Protected routes cannot be accessed when logged out; attempting direct access redirects to login.\n   - Session token refresh is simulated (e.g., refresh call extends session) and this is observable (session expiry extended, UI not logged out prematurely).\n\n3. Routing & Guards\n   - Route guards prevent access to Admin-only pages for non-Admin roles.\n   - Breadcrumbs reflect navigation path on each dashboard view.\n\n4. Layout & Responsiveness\n   - Responsive sidebar with collapsible behavior on small screens.\n   - Top header contains profile avatar/menu, a notifications indicator, and a functional search control.\n   - Layout adapts across common viewport widths (mobile/tablet/desktop) without layout breaks.\n\n5. Dashboard views & navigation\n   - Four primary views are present: Overview, Analytics, Users, Settings.\n   - Navigation between views is functional and shows correct breadcrumbs and content.\n\n6. Data visualization\n   - At least three chart types (line, bar, pie) are implemented and rendered using a charting library.\n   - Charts support interactive features (hover tooltips, legend toggles, zoom or pan if applicable).\n   - Charts update in real time (simulated) at a configurable interval and a toggle exists to pause/resume updates.\n   - Charts can be filtered by date range and reflect selected range immediately.\n\n7. Export functionality\n   - Users can export chart visuals (e.g., PNG/SVG) and table data (CSV) from the UI.\n   - Exported files are downloadable and contain the expected content (chart image/table rows matching current filter).\n\n8. Tables & data management\n   - Data tables support sorting by column, filtering, and pagination.\n   - Bulk selection is possible (select all on page, multi-select), with at least Delete and Export bulk operations implemented.\n   - Inline editing for user records is available; edited fields persist in the mock dataset and the table updates to reflect changes.\n   - Delete operations prompt confirmation and remove items from the mock dataset.\n\n9. Real-time & simulated backend behavior\n   - Real-time updates are simulated (e.g., WebSocket mock, polling, or event emitter) and reflected in charts/tables.\n   - Simulated server responses include latency and token-refresh behavior for session simulation.\n\n10. Accessibility & UI quality\n    - Keyboard navigation works for primary controls (sidebar toggles, table row selection, modal dialogs).\n    - Basic ARIA attributes present for interactive elements (modals, alerts, menus).\n\n11. Code quality & testing\n    - TypeScript types are used for key data models (user, metrics, events).\n    - Critical components include unit or integration tests (example test suites or one end-to-end smoke test).\n    - Clear README with setup/run instructions and notes on mock data and simulated behaviors.\n\nAssumptions (clarifying choices or constraints)\n- Authentication is mock/client-side for this sprint: no real auth provider or secure backend is required. Token refresh is simulated and not cryptographically secure.\n- Backend is a mock/local data layer (in-memory, JSON files, or a small API route) that simulates latency and streaming; no production database integration is required.\n- Real-time updates are simulated (client-side interval/polling or a mock WebSocket server). No production push infrastructure required.\n- UI library/tooling: choose a modern combo (Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui or Radix UI, or a component library like MUI) \u2014 exact choice is left to implementer.\n- Charting library: use a popular library with React support (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, ApexCharts, or d3 wrappers). Choice is left to implementer but must support export and interactivity.\n- Export formats: CSV for table data and PNG (or SVG) for charts are acceptable unless a different format is requested.\n- Pagination and sorting can be client-side using the mock dataset; server-side pagination is optional if you simulate it via API routes.\n- Inline edits and bulk operations modify the mock dataset in memory or persisted to localStorage; no persistent backend required.\n- Role behavior: Admin has full access, User has limited actions (e.g., cannot access Settings), Viewer is read-only.\n- Security: Because auth is mocked, do not rely on this implementation for production security.\n- Browser support: modern evergreen browsers; Node 18+ for local dev environment.\n- Testing: minimal test coverage is acceptable for sprint testing; full e2e coverage is optional beyond a smoke test.\n\nIf you want, I can convert these into a prioritized implementation checklist, create concrete UI/component contracts (props/types), or produce a sample project scaffold (file/folder layout + selected libraries).
