# Sample Specification (Sprint Testing)

This lightweight specification seeds the Requirements agent during development and testing. It describes the expectations for the canonical Next.js dashboard scenario.

## Overview

- Build a Next.js 15 dashboard with TypeScript and the App Router.
- Include a top navigation bar, summary cards, and a sortable data table.
- Stub authentication and environment configuration; do not integrate real providers yet.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `npm run dev` should launch on port 3000 without runtime errors.
2. Provide ESLint and formatting scripts aligned with the latest Next.js recommendations.
3. Generate an initial smoke test that checks the dashboard route renders.

## Notes

- Keep dependencies MIT/Apache/BSD licensed.
- Document setup steps, testing commands, and known limitations in the generated README.
