# RFC: Multi-Agent JSON-to-Code Generation System

## Overview

This document specifies the requirements for a multi-agent system that takes JSON project specifications and generates complete software solutions. The system will use the Kimi-k2-0905-preview model via OpenAI-compatible APIs to create specialized agents for requirements analysis, code generation, testing, and documentation.

The system will process JSON files containing project specifications (similar to the provided bioinformatics-etl-cli example) and output fully functional codebases with comprehensive testing, documentation, and version control integration.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- Generate production-ready code from JSON specifications
- Implement comprehensive testing suites with high coverage
- Create detailed documentation and README files
- Maintain code quality through automated tools and standards
- Support version control integration with Git
- Enable intelligent decision-making for incomplete specifications

### Secondary Goals
- Cache common patterns and templates for faster generation
- Research best practices and package documentation via web tools
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed artifact generation
- Support various project types and technology stacks

## Assumptions

1. Input JSON files will always follow the same structural format as the provided example
2. The Kimi-k2-0905-preview model is accessible via OpenAI-compatible API
3. SQLite will be used for agent state management and caching
4. The system will have internet access for researching best practices
5. Target deployment environment supports Python 3.13+ and required dependencies
6. Generated projects will be stored locally on the file system
7. Version control operations will be performed using Git CLI tools
