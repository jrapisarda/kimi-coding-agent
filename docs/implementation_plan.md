# Implementation Plan: Local-First Multi-Agent Coding System

## 1. Foundations & Environment
- **Runtime & SDK Setup**
  - Pin Python >=3.11 (prefer 3.13) and ensure Node.js >=18.18 is discoverable.
  - Install OpenAI Python SDK with Responses API & Agents SDK support; scaffold config for API keys.
  - Configure optional web_search / file_search tool toggles with license filtering safeguards.
- **Project Scaffolding**
  - Initialize CLI entrypoint `agent run` with Typer/Click style interface.
  - Establish configuration loading (env vars + CLI flags) and logging baseline with structured events.

## 2. Persistence & Local-First Infrastructure
- **SQLite Run Store**
  - Design schema capturing runs, agent steps, artifacts, provenance, SBOM, test results, and environment snapshots.
  - Implement migration bootstrap and lightweight ORM/DAO utilities.
- **Workspace Snapshotting**
  - Integrate filesystem snapshot mechanism (e.g., copy-on-write or tarball) before each run.
  - Implement rollback flow with diagnostics persistence on failure.

## 3. Agent Orchestration Pipeline
- **Agent Contracts**
  - Define shared context schema for Requirements → Coding → Testing → Documentation handoffs.
  - Encode deterministic metadata (seeds, versions, run IDs) for reproducibility.
- **Controller & Scheduling**
  - Build orchestrator that sequences agents, applies retries/backoff, and streams progress.
  - Surface concise run summaries and exit codes to CLI.
- **OpenAI Tooling Integration**
  - Wrap Responses API calls with tracing, provenance logging, and license guardrails.
  - Enable Code Interpreter by default; support opt-in Web/Search tools with policy enforcement.

## 4. Agent Implementations
- **Requirements Agent**
  - Parse prompts/input docs; emit structured spec JSON aligning to reference user stories.
  - Validate assumptions (Python/Node versions, licensing, tool availability).
- **Coding Agent**
  - Generate project scaffolding using current ecosystem templates (Next.js 15, FastAPI 0.118+, pandas 2.3+, scikit-learn 1.7+).
  - Manage dependency installation commands and sandbox execution.
- **Testing Agent**
  - Auto-generate pytest suites or FE smoke tests per stack and execute them with captured reports.
  - Implement "fix-forward once" heuristics (e.g., dependency re-pin) before rollback.
- **Documentation Agent**
  - Produce README with quickstart, commands, known limitations, and reproducibility summary.
  - Package dist/<run_id>.zip with artifacts, logs, and metadata manifest.

## 5. Quality & Security Controls
- **License & Provenance Guardrails**
  - Detect and block non-MIT/Apache/BSD snippets; record source URLs/licenses in SQLite.
- **Security Hygiene**
  - Redact secrets from logs, validate user inputs, and isolate subprocess execution.
- **Monitoring & Metrics**
  - Capture run duration, resource usage, and outcomes for reference project validation loop.

## 6. Validation & Reference Projects
- Execute the four canonical reference scenarios (Next.js dashboard, FastAPI CRUD, CSV↔SQLite ETL, scikit-learn pipeline).
- Enforce <10 minute budget per run and summarize success metrics.
- Document remaining open questions (tool defaults, version policies, artifact retention) for stakeholder review.

## 7. Stretch Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Pattern caching, extended test coverage, CI/CD integration, monitoring dashboards.
- Guardrails/enterprise controls (PII masking, jailbreak detection) if required by stakeholders.
