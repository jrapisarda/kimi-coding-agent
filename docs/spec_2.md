# Advanced Dashboard Specification (Sprint Testing)

This specification describes a more comprehensive dashboard application for testing development agents with realistic complexity.

## Overview

Build a Next.js 15 dashboard application with TypeScript, App Router, and modern UI patterns. The application should serve as an analytics platform with multiple data views and interactive components.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement mock authentication with role-based access (Admin, User, Viewer)
- Session management with token refresh simulation
- Protected routes and route guards

### 2. Dashboard Layout
- Responsive sidebar navigation with collapsible menu
- Top header with user profile, notifications, and search
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Multiple dashboard views: Overview, Analytics, Users, Settings

### 3. Data Visualization
- Interactive charts (line, bar, pie) using a charting library
- Real-time data updates (simulated)
- Customizable date range filters
- Export functionality for charts and tables

### 4. Data Management
- Sortable, filterable, paginated data tables
- Bulk operations (select, delete, export)
- Inline editing for user records
- Data validation and error handling

### 5. Advanced Features
- Dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
- Internationalization (i18n) support with language switcher
- Settings persistence using localStorage
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Error boundaries with graceful fallbacks

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Next.js 15 with App Router and React 18
- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Component library (Radix UI or similar)
- State management (Zustand or Context API)
- API routes for mock data endpoints

### Data Flow
- RESTful API simulation with 200ms delay
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error states and retry mechanisms
- Client-side caching strategy

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests with Testing Library
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing setup

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1 (Core)
1. ✅ Application builds without errors and runs on port 3001
2. ✅ Authentication flow works with mock login/logout
3. ✅ Main dashboard renders with summary cards and basic charts
4. ✅ Responsive design works on desktop and mobile

### Phase 2 (Advanced)
5. ✅ Data tables support sorting, filtering, and pagination
6. ✅ Theme switching and user preferences persist
7. ✅ Internationalization with at least 2 languages
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

### Phase 3 (Polish)
9. ✅ Loading states and error handling throughout
10. ✅ Performance optimization (Lighthouse score >90)
11. ✅ Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
12. ✅ Production build succeeds and deploys without issues

## Non-Functional Requirements

- All dependencies must be MIT/Apache/BSD licensed
- Bundle size under 500KB gzipped
- First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds
- SEO-optimized with proper meta tags
- Comprehensive documentation in README

## Mock Data Specifications

- Users: 50+ records with name, email, role, status, join date
- Analytics: 6 months of time-series data for metrics
- Charts: Multiple data sets for different visualization types

## Deliverables

1. Complete source code with TypeScript
2. Comprehensive README with setup instructions
3. Test suite with running instructions
4. Performance audit report
5. Known limitations documentation

## Notes

- Use placeholder images from unsplash or similar
- Mock API responses should include error cases (5% failure rate)
- Focus on code quality over feature completeness
- Include code quality tools (Prettier, ESLint, Husky)
